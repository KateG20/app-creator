# App-creator

A Clojure app designed to easily create:
- scripts for creating and filling databases (currently: only for Postgresql)
- server projects with handlers (currently: only with Spring Framework)
- client projects with API requests (currently: only mobile app for Android)
- files for your apps and databases quick containerization (currently: only with Docker)

**Notice.** While server and client projects will be created and filled and be ready for use, 
the resulting sql-commands, as well as the commands for running containers, 
will not be called. You will just get .bat-files with scripts which you can edit and run
whenever you want. This is because it's *highly likely* that you will need to edit or 
concrete something in the generated data before running containers or creating databases.

## Usage

```
>> app-creator start
               -i my_data.yml 
               -o my_output
```
For more information about command format, use `-h` or `--help` option.

Here, output is a correct absolute path to directory with quotes.

Input is a correct absolute path to existing .yml/.yaml-file with quotes. 
It contains all the information about what you need to create.
Contents of the input file **must have the following format**:

```yaml
